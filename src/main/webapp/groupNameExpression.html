<p>Specify a regular expression to build groups of jobs that will be categorized in the view.</p>
<p>If you use parenthesis to specify a group, the name of the group will be the group match.<br/>
If you don't specify any matching group, the whole expression will be used to build the 
group name. If you just want to include specific jobs to specific labels without bothering with regular expressions,
you just put the full job name in this field and the explicit label on the naming rule field.
</p>
<p>Examples: 
<ul>
<li>"a[0-9]+" The group match will be an 'a' followed by a number.</li>
<li>"a([0-9]+) The group match will be a just a number.</li>
<li>"^my job name|another job$" This will include just the specified jobs.</li>
</ul>
